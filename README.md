# Final-Project
Soil Moisture Detection Using Digital Images.
This project trains data created by myself. The dataset includes images and they are divided into labeled folders. 
The AlexModel.m is a script where the AlexNet Convolutional Neuron Network will train the dataset. It converts all types of formats and sizes into 227x227.
The classifying.m is a script that allows to select any random image from the web in any kinds of formats
Image_Classifier.mlapp is an application where an image is upload and therefore is classified, using the AlexNet Deep Learning Network.
The Demo AlexNet.mlappinstall is a package to be installed on MATLAB.
The application has been compiled and ready to use in any machine, however, its size is about 2GB, as includes Deep Learning Network packages.
